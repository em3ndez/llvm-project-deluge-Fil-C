# OK, we need to strip everything, but:
#
# - We cannot use the system's strip, because it might not be the right version. We know which strip
#   version we need. In fact, the one we built would work great.
# - But we cannot use that strip unless we do the LFS section 8.84 hack. That hack is gross, and I'm
#   worried it's a bit flaky. Basically - we cannot use the strip we built to strip the strip we built
#   or any libraries that the strip we built depends on.
#
# So, we build ourselves our own strip! And we build it using Yolo-C, so that we can be sure that it
# doesn't depend on any of the libraries we are about to strip.
